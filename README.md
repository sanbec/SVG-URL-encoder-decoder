# SVG-URL-encoder-decoder
This tool allows you to **encode SVG files** for use as urls within the `background-image`, `border-image` and `mask-image` CSS properties.

It also performs the reverse decode operation, **useful if you find an encoded SVG you want to modify**. You can also **download the SVG file** resulting from the decoding operation.

In addition, **you can drag and drop SVG files** into the plain SVG area, which saves you from having to open the SVG with a text editor and then copy and paste.

It is a fork of the [codepen yoksel's tool](https://codepen.io/yoksel/pen/MWKeKK) that I have changed the styling of, inspired by and copied some fragment from [this pen from elliz](https://codepen.io/elliz/pen/ygvgay).

I have added the decoding option, although I have copied the one made by [yoksel on github](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/).

For the drag and drop part I used the code from [this pen fom Emmanuel Ulloa](https://codepen.io/emmanuelulloa/pen/Bpzmvj).

To create and download the SVG file, I used [this clear code from skyajay](https://codepen.io/skyajay/pen/PopVod).

Is there anything that can't be found in codepen?
